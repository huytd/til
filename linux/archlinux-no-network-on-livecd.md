# No network on LiveCD boot

If you got this problem, and you're thinking that your laptop's wifi driver is not available on ArchLinux, think again. Most of the driver are available for ArchLinux. 

There is one thing you should try:

```
wifi-menu
```

This will scan for wifi and connect it for you.
